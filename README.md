# Options

** This is a current project that I am working on and still needs to be tested and have more features added; it is in a very rough draft state at the moment

Currently, it takes a portfolio of positions of European options and will calculate the total fair market value of the portfolio using the Black Scholed model and sum up 18 different Greeks to display the total risk of the portfolio. It can go through over 15,000 positions in a portfolio per second.
